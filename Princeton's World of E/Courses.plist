		<string>An introduction to computer science in the context of scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The goal of the course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, while at the same time preparing students to use computers effectively for applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. Topics include: hardware and software systems; programming in Java; algorithms and data structures; fundamental principles of computation; and scientific computing, including simulation, optimization, and data analysis. Two lectures, two precepts.

		<string>This is a course about the practice of programming. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves &amp; others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.</string>

		<string>Course teaches engineering students about issues tackled by leading Chief Technology Officers: the technical visionaries and/or managers who innovate at the boundaries of technology and business by understanding both deeply, and who are true partners to the CEO, not just implementers of business goals. Focus will be on thinking like a CTO (of a startup and a large company) from technology and business perspectives, and on software and Internet-based businesses. Industry-leading guest speakers provide perspectives too.

		<string>The mission of the class is to enable students to successfully create and lead enterprises by teaching the basic skills required to be a successful entrepreneurial leader. This class compliments EGR 491 &quot;High Tech Entrepreneurship&quot; which focuses on &apos;giving birth to a company&apos;, by focusing instead on enterprise &apos;early child rearing&apos;. The basic skills taught fall into three major categories: how to create and manage powerful relationships, how to know and manage yourself, in addition to understanding how organizations work as they evolve from the idea stage to become value producing, self-sustaining enterprises.

		<string>Technology and society are unthinkable without each other - each provides the means and framework in which the other develops. To explore this dynamic, this course investigates a wide array of questions on the interaction between technology, society, politics, and economics, emphasizing the themes of innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure, and ethics and expertise. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, genetically-modified organisms, regulation of the internet, medical mistakes, intellectual property, the financial crisis of 2008, and the post-fossil-fuels economy.</string>

What impact do these systems have on relationships, mobility, global systems, activism, sustainability and art? And can we design new systems to support these experiences? This senior seminar will bring together students in the social and computing sciences in an introduction to qualitative studies in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), to examine our assumptions in computing systems and reach for new dimensions of user experience.</string>

		<string>This course provides real world, hands-on learning on what it&apos;s like to actually start a high-tech company. This class is not about how to write a business plan. Instead you will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a start-up actually works. You&apos;ll work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. You&apos;ll learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company. Each week will be new adventure as you test each part of your business model and then share the hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.</string>

		<string>Radical innovation solves big problems and alters the way we live, colliding with government polices as the effects ripple across national frontiers. Where do these innovations come from, how do they work, and what policy problems do they cause? This class examines the impact of technical innovation on a global scale. Students learn how innovations in areas such as satellite imaging, global positioning, internet search engines, and pandemic vaccines have a profound impact on foreign policy. Students learn to think about innovation from the standpoint of business managers, government regulators, social entrepreneurs, in very practical terms.

It looks closely at what anthropologists mean by culture and why most development experts fail to attend to the cultural forces that hold communities together. By examining development projects from South Asia to the United States, students learn the relevance of exchange relations, genealogies, power, religion, and indigenous law. This semester the class will focus on energy and water.</string>
